# Vidripper: A bookmarklet to record and download video / livestreams in browser.

Install: Copy and paste everything inside bookmarklet-raw.txt into a new bookmark. Go to the website of choice and run the script. Video must remain unpaused for it to work.

Note: Some videos / livestreams will mute themselves when you start recording them. This is normal and the sound is still going to be in the output video!

Future features: unpause / pause support (doesn't work as of right now), support for HTML canvas elements, better way to control video resolution / compression (can be bad sometimes).

Known to work on youtube.com and twitch.tv, still needs to be tested on other social medias. If it doesn't work on a website, raise an issue and I'll try to fix it as soon as possible.
